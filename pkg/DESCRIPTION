Description: Cusp-catastrophe modeling using Cobb's maximum
        likelihood method (Grasman, van der Maas, & Wagenmakers, 2009, JSS, 32:8;
        Cobb, 1981, Behavioral Science, 26:1, 75--78).
        Includes a cusp() function for model fitting, and several
        utility functions for plotting, and for comparing the
        model to linear regression and logistic curve models.
